/**
 * \par Description:
 * Creates a client identification string with given method. Client is a process at the other
 * side of socket.
 *
 * \par Purpose:
 * Client identification string is required for cynara_check() and cynara_async_create_request()
 * functions.
 *
 * \par Typical use case:
 * The function is called before the call of cynara_check() or cynara_async_create_request()
 * function. Returned string is used as client parameter in cynara_check() or
 * cynara_async_create_request() function. String is released with free() function when it is no
 * longer needed.
 *
 * \par Method of function operation:
 * The function generates client string using SO_PEERCRED on socket.
 *
 * \par Sync (or) Async:
 * This is a synchronous API.
 *
 * \par Thread safety:
 * This function is NOT thread-safe. If functions from described API are called by multithreaded
 * application from different threads, they must be put into mutex protected critical section.
 *
 * \par Important notes:
 * Memory for returned client string is obtained with malloc(), and should be freed with free().
 * Allocated string is returned only, when function succeeds.
 * If method is CLIENT_METHOD_DEFAULT then it will be chosen based on Cynara configuration file.
 *
 * \param[in] socket_fd Descriptor of open connected UNIX socket
 * \param[in] method Method of client identifier creation
 * \param[out] client Placeholder for allocated string containing client id
 *
 * \return CYNARA_API_SUCCESS on success
 * \return CYNARA_API_INVALID_PARAM when client is NULL or socket_fd is not valid connected socket
 *                                  descriptor
 * \return CYNARA_API_METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED when requested method is not supported
 * \return CYNARA_API_CONFIGURATION_ERROR if the configuration file can not be opened or
 *                                        there are errors in configuration file
 * \return CYNARA_API_OUT_OF_MEMORY when there was error allocating memory

/**
 * \par Description:
 * Creates a user identification string with given method. User is an executor of process
 * at the other side of socket.
 *
 * \par Purpose:
 * User identification string is required for cynara_check() and cynara_async_create_request()
 * functions.
 *
 * \par Typical use case:
 * The function is called before the call of cynara_check() or cynara_async_create_request()
 * function. Returned string is used as user parameter in cynara_check() or

/**
 * \par Description:
 * Return PID of process at the other side of socket.
 *
 * \par Purpose:
 * PID may be used for client_session creation with cynara_session_from_pid() function
 * from libcynara-session library. Client_session is needed for cynara_check()
 * and cynara_async_create_request() functions.
 *
 * \par Typical use case:
 * The function is called before the call of cynara_session_from_pid() function.
 *
 * \par Method of function operation:
 * The function reads PID of peer using SO_PEERCRED on socket.
