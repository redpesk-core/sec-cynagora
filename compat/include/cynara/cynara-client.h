 * \par Purpose:
 * For configuration parameter to be used in cynara_initialize() function, this API must be

 * It will create cynara_configuration structure, an optional parameter of cynara initialization.
 *
 * \par Typical use case:
 * Once before setting parameters of cynara configuration and passing to
 * cynara_initialize().
 *
 * \par Method of function operation:
 * This API initializes inner library structures and in case of success returns pointer
 * to created cynara_configuration structure.
 *
 * \par Sync (or) Async:
 * This as a synchronous API.
 *
 * \par Thread-safety:
 * This function is NOT thread-safe. If functions from described API are called by multithreaded
 * application from different threads, they must be put into protected critical section.
 *
 * \par Important notes:
 * Structure cynara_configuration created by cynara_configuration_create() call
 * should be released with cynara_configuration_destroy().
 * Structure cynara_configuration should be destroyed after passing it to
 * cynara_initialize().

/**
 * \par Description:
 * Check client, user access for given privilege.
 *
 * \par Purpose:
 * This API should be used to check if a user running application identified as client
 * has access to a privilege.
 *
 * \par Typical use case:
 * A service want to ask trusted process (Cynara), if a client demanding access to some privilege
 * has proper rights.
 *
 * \par Method of function operation:
 * Client (a process / application) demanding access to a privilege is running as some user.
 * For such triple an access to a privilege is checked by calling cynara.
 * Depending on defined policy, an external application may be launched to ask user a question,
 * e.g. if [s]he wants to allow client to use a privilege. Additional parameter client_session
 * may be used to distinguish between client session (e.g. for allowing access only for this
 * particular application launch).
 *
 * \par Sync (or) Async:
 * This is a Synchronous API.
 *
 * \par Thread-safeness:
 * This function is NOT thread-safe. If functions from described API are called by multithreaded
 * application from different threads, they must be put into mutex protected critical section.
 *
 * \par Important notes:
 * \parblock
 * An external application may be launched to allow user interaction in granting or denying access.
 *
 * Call to cynara_check() needs cynara structure to be created first with call to
 * cynara_initialize().
 *
 * String length cannot exceed CYNARA_MAX_ID_LENGTH, otherwise CYNARA_API_INVALID_PARAM will be
 * returned.
 * \endparblock
 *

 * \param[in] client Application or process identifier.
 * \param[in] client_session Session of client (connection, launch).
 * \param[in] user User running client.
 * \param[in] privilege Privilege that is a subject of a check..
 *
 * \return CYNARA_API_ACCESS_ALLOWED on access allowed, CYNARA_API_ACCESS_DENIED on access denial
 * or other error code on error.

/**
 * \par Description:
 * Check for (potential) permission to take some action or access a resource.
 *
 * \par Purpose:
 * This API should be used for a quick check if a user running application identified as client
 * has access to a given privilege.
 *
 * \par Typical use case:
 * An application may use this API to check, if it has (potential) permission to take some action
 * or access resource in future (permissions may rarely change). The typical use would be to disable
 * or hide some of functionalities, if they probably could not be used anyways.
 *
 * \par Method of function operation:
 * This function is very similar to cynara_check() with the difference, that in case of answer not
 * being one of CYNARA_API_ACCESS_DENIED or CYNARA_API_ACCESS_ALLOWED, no external application will
 * be consulted. Instead, CYNARA_API_ACCESS_NOT_RESOLVED is returned, meaning, that only running
 * full cynara_check() API would yield eventual answer.
 * Similarly, like in cynara_check(), argument client_session can be used to distinguish client
 * sessions and grant possibility to yield answer from cache.
 *
 * \par Sync (or) Async:
 * This is a synchronous API.
 *
 * \par Thread-safety:
 * This function is NOT thread-safe. If functions from described API are called by multithreaded
 * application from different threads, they must be put into mutex protected critical section.
 *
 * \par Important notes:
 * \parblock
 * The answer will be taken from Cynara's database without consulting any external applications.
 * If the answer cannot be resolved in one of CYNARA_API_PERMISSION_DENIED or
 * CYNARA_API_PERMISSION_ALLOWED without communicating with external application the API will return
 * CYNARA_API_ACCESS_NOT_RESOLVED.
 *
 * Call to cynara_simple_check() needs cynara structure to be created first with call to
 * cynara_initialize(). String length cannot exceed CYNARA_MAX_ID_LENGTH, otherwise
 * CYNARA_API_INVALID_PARAM will be returned.
