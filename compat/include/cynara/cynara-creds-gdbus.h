/**
 * \par Description:
 * Creates a client identification string with given method. Client is a process identified by the
 * unique name at the other side of the dbus connection.
 *
 * \par Purpose:
 * Client identification string is required for cynara_check() and cynara_async_create_request()
 * functions.
 *
 * \par Typical use case:
 * The function is called before the call of cynara_check() or cynara_async_create_request()
 * function. Returned string is used as client parameter in cynara_check() or
 * cynara_async_create_request() function. String is released with g_free() function when it is no
 * longer needed.
 *
 * \par Method of function operation:
 * The function generates client string by calling a method from DBus Interface
 * ("org.freedesktop.DBus") which is placed on system bus ("org.freedesktop.DBus").
 *
 * \par Sync (or) Async:
 * This is a synchronous API.
 *
 * \par Thread safety:
 * This function is NOT thread-safe. If functions from described API are called by multithreaded
 * application from different threads, they must be put into mutex protected critical section.
 *
 * \par Important notes:
 * Memory for returned user string should be freed with g_free().
 * Allocated string is returned only, when function succeeds.
 * If method is CLIENT_METHOD_DEFAULT then it will be chosen based on Cynara configuration file.
 *
 * \param[in] connection DBus connection to a bus. It manages incomming and outgoing messages
 * \param[in] uniqueName DBus identifier of the client
 * \param[in] method Method of client identifier creation
 * \param[out] client Placeholder for allocated string containing client id
 *
 * \return CYNARA_API_SUCCESS on success
 * \return CYNARA_API_INVALID_PARAM when client is NULL or uniqueName or client has wrong
 *                                  value (i.e NULL or non-existing)
 * \return CYNARA_API_CONFIGURATION_ERROR if the configuration file can not be opened or
 *                                        there are errors in configuration file
 * \return CYNARA_API_METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED when requested method is not supported
